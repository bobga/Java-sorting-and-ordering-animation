# Sorting & Ordering Visualization

## Overview

This JavaFX application provides a visual representation of various sorting and ordering algorithms using bar charts. Users can interact with the application by triggering different algorithms to observe how they sort and arrange the bars.

## Features

- **Visualization**: Each bar in the chart represents a data point, and the height of the bar corresponds to its value.
- **Randomization**: Users can randomize the initial order of bars to create different starting points for the algorithms.
- **Algorithms**: Several sorting and ordering algorithms are available for visualization, including:
  - Randomization
  - Swap Halves
  - Reverse All
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Animation Control**: Users can adjust the animation delay to observe the sorting process at different speeds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- JavaFX SDK

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bobga/Java-sorting-and-ordering-animation.git
  ```
## Usage
- **Randomize**: Generates a random arrangement of bars.
- **Swap Halves**: Swaps the positions of the first and second halves of the bars.
- **Reverse All**: Reverses the order of all bars in the chart.
- **Bubble Sort**: Executes the bubble sort algorithm to arrange the bars in ascending order.
- **Selection Sort**: Executes the selection sort algorithm to arrange the bars in ascending order.
- **Insertion Sort**: Executes the insertion sort algorithm to arrange the bars in ascending order.
- **Animation Delay**: Adjusts the animation delay in milliseconds to control the speed of the sorting process.

## Development
This application is developed using JavaFX, a cross-platform GUI toolkit for Java. It leverages JavaFX's rich set of UI components and animation capabilities to create an interactive visualization of sorting algorithms.
